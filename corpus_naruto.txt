Hatake Kakashi said:
(Naruto)
I've been around longer than you have, kid. And I've seen my share of troubles. You're not the only one who knows what it's like to lose somebody. It looks like neither of us has led a charming life, have we? Still, it's not that bad. At least you and I have been lucky enough to find new comrades to help fill the void.
Itachi Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
Kabuto: Isn't acknowledging what you can't do the same as giving up?
Itachi: No, it means to forgive yourself for what you aren't able to do. Your comrades are there to make up for what you cannot do and to prevent you from ignoring things that you actually might have been able to do.

List of characters from Naruto
Itachi Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
I'll admit that you're stronger than before. But because of that, you seem to have lost sight of what's truly important. Now listen carefully. The people of the village, who once abhorred you, have begun to admire you. They think of you as a comrade. It's because you fought hard for their acceptance. You once said it was everyone who cares about you who helped you get where you are now. If you forget others because you have power, and become arrogant and egotistical, you'll eventually become just like Madara. No matter how powerful you become, do not try to shoulder everything alone. Becoming the Hokage doesn't mean people will acknowledge you. But when the people acknowledge you, you can become Hokage. Never forget your friends!
Gaara said:
(Naruto)
Three times now... We've fought world wars for our own nations, our own villages. We've hurt one another. We've hated one another. That hatred bred a lust for power, and that lust for power created ME. I was a Jinchuuriki, the embodiment of hatred and power. And I hated this world, and all the people in it... I wanted to destroy it with my own hands. The exact same thing Akatsuki is trying to do today. But one man, one ninja from Konoha stopped me. I was his enemy, yet he wept for me! I hurt him, yet he called me his friend! He saved me! My enemy, my fellow Jinchuuriki... He suffered the same pain as me, yet bore no ill will! There are no enemies here because we've all suffered at Akatsuki's hand! SO THERE IS NO SAND, NO STONE, NO LEAF, NO MIST, NO CLOUD! THERE ARE ONLY SHINOBI! And if you still hold a grudge against the Sand, then when this war is over, come and take my head instead! Our enemies are after the friend who saved my life! If they take him, if we hand him over, our world is finished! I want to protect him, and I want to protect our world! But I'm too young to protect it all on my own! All of you lend me your aid!
Gaara said:
(Naruto)
Now there's something I understand a little better. Hate, sadness, even joy. To be able to share it with another person... Naruto Uzumaki. From fighting him I learned that. He knew pain like I did and then he taught me that you can change your path. I wish that one day I can be needed by someone. Not as a frightening weapon... But as the sand's Kazekage.

Kimimaro said:
(Naruto)
Humans... Do humans have a purpose when they are born? I have been wondering recently. Because they are born, do they have an important duty? The meaning of being born... For humans to find that answer... It is the one freedom God gave them.
Madara Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
Man seeks peace, yet at the same time yearning for war... Those are the two realms belonging solely to man. Thinking of peace whilst spilling blood is something that only humans could do. They're two sides of the same coin... to protect something... another must be sacrificed.
Pain said:
(Naruto)
People are stupid. If I don't do this, there will be no peace. Eventually, time will pass and the pain will heal. Eventually, checkmate's power will weaken and people will begin fighting again. This time, they will use the weapon themselves and once more know true pain. And for the short time, peace will come again. It will give birth to short period of peace within this endless chain of hatred. That's my wish.

Hatake Kakashi said:
(Naruto)
The hole in one's heart gets filled by others around you. Friends won't flock to someone who abandons the memory of his friends and gives up on the world just because things don't go the way he wants them to. That won't help fill the hole in your heart. And people won't help those who run away and do nothing. As long as you don't give up, there will always be salvation.
Itachi Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
No single thing is perfect by itself. That's why we're born to attract other things to make up for what we lack. I think we start walking in the right direction only after we start getting our counterparts beside us.
Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
Regardless of our limitations, we can always be of some use. Our power may seem insignificant... but it may just prove to be useful in the grand scheme of things. Stay focused. Never avert your eyes, because if an opening arises, even our insignificant power may be enough to determine the fate of the world. Which is why everyone must stay alert and ready to strike at any moment!

Sai said:
(Naruto)
It's because Sakura loves Sasuke that she doesn't want him to sink any lower. It's because she loves him that she wants to rescue him from the evil path he currently walks. Even if the only way to do it is to kill him with her own two hands, I believe, she's prepared to do it because she loves him.
Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
Someday, I just want to marry a regular girl who isn't too ugly and not too pretty. Have two children, first a girl, then a boy. Retire after my daughter is married and my son becomes a successful ninja, and spend the rest of my life playing shōgi or Go. Then die of old age before my wife.

List of characters from Naruto
Hatake Kakashi said:
(Naruto)
In the shinobi world, those that break the written and unwritten rules are deemed trash... but be that as it may... Those that would desregard their comrades so easily are even worse than trash. And those who don't have the decency to respect the memories of their comrades are the worst.
Hatake Kakashi said:
(Naruto)
I really am... shinobi trash. But the one thing I still learned is this. That void is something that everyone helps you fill. Just because you face adversity and hardships, is no reason to give up on this world. A person willing to throw away all those memories... of their friends and comrades, will never find peace of mind. Resorting to something like that isn't going to bury that hole. If you persevere and endure, someone will be there to support you!
Madara Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
Nine-Tails, you are merely a momentary life, a temporary existence of coalesced energy... energy that once was a single, ultimate form! An unstable force, lacking in intelligence or sapience, you require a guide to show you purpose. That guide is the Uchiha! The tailed beasts are but slaves to those with blessed eyes. Obey!
Pain said:
(Naruto)
Love is the reason why there is pain. When we lose someone precious to us, hate is born. Vengeance is the product of that hate and so death follows. But in death there is only more death. This will give rise to more pains. In this cursed world we live in, it is a cycle of hatred that will not cease. You and I seek the same thing that Jiraiya-sensei wanted. Let me ask you this: How will you confront this hatred in order to create peace?
Gaara said:
(Naruto)
Naruto... Just so you know, there will be a war to protect the Eight-Tails and Nine-Tails. In other words - you. For the sake of the ninja world and as the Kazekage, I will guard you with my life. If as a member of Akatsuki, Sasuke Uchiha stands in the way of the ninja coalition... I will show him no mercy.
Itachi Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
I always lied to you telling you to forgive me. I used these hands to keep you at distance... I did not want you to get involved. But now... I think you could have changed father and mother. Perhaps even the entire Uchiha. If I would have stood in front of you and looked you in the eyes from the very beginning... talked to you instead of down to you... and been open about everything. But I failed, and speaking to you now, like this, isn't going to undo the permanent damage that's already been done to you. That's why I wanted to show you the truth. Even if it's just a little. And no matter what you decide to do from here on out, you never have to forgive me - I will always love you.
Madara Uchiha said:
(Naruto)
In this world, wherever there is light - there are also shadows. As long as the concept of winners exists, there must also be losers. The selfish desire of wanting to maintain peace causes wars, and hatred is born to protect love.

Pain said:
(Naruto)
How can you say that you will never change? That you will not change, no matter how great the pain you face? Can you continue believing in yourself forever? Can you guarantee it? Can you have such faith in yourself?!
Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
*To himself, while fighting Temari* Oh man... those clouds are so lucky. so free. More to the point, I didn't feel like doing this in the first place. And I only became a ninja because I thought life would've been more interesting as one... I suppose things aren't gonna be that simple.
Neji Hyuuga said:
(Naruto)
Hinata... this is the unalterable difference in strength... the distinction that separates the elite from the failure. This is the unchangeable reality. From the moment you said you wouldn't run, your defeat was inevitable. The only possible outcome was your present despair... Withdraw!

Haku said:
(Naruto)
Often people have it wrong, mistakenly believing... that showing mercy to an enemy is kindness. They spare the foe whose life is in their hands. But don't you see? It's an empty existence, to go on living... alone and unloved... when defeat's already cost you your dream!
Uzumaki Naruto said:
(Naruto)
Sasuke, I always knew you were alone. In the beginning I was glad because I thought you were like me - I wanted to talk to you! But you... didn't speak. You always had everyone watching you. You could do everything and we were too different. So I decided that you would become my rival. I didn't want to lose because I was called a loser all the time. Even when we became Team 7, I still thought this way. I always tried to lie but... but the truth is... I always wanted to be like you. I aspired to be like you. Because of that... I was glad that you wanted to fight me.

Akamaru, what's wrong boy? Have you forgotten my scent? We've always been together haven't we? We grew up together. Akamaru please, somewhere in there, there has to be a part of you that remembers. Show me that you remember. AKAMARU! Forgive me. Can you? I know that I've brought you nothing but pain and suffering. I broke my word. I swore I'd always protect you. Akamaru I'm sorry. Sorry I wasn't a better master. I'm here. Here for you. Forever.

[Thinking] What a sucker. He doesn't know I can re-establish control over my puppet within a blink of an eye. It's what makes me an expert puppet master. And so what if Crow's body is out of commission? I don't need his body. Every part of him is a lethal weapon. [To Shino] Looks like you underestimated me, bug boy. For the last time! There's enough poison on that to drop an elephant, so you're dead.

Iruka Umino said:
(Naruto)
[as a child] Why should I be sad?! My parents died protecting the village from the monster fox. They're heroes, and I'm the son of those heroes! If I cry, it's because I'm happy! I'm not even sad that they went and left me all alone...
Iruka Umino said:
(Naruto)
It seems like the small leaves in the Village of Konoha have inherited that "will of fire" you spoke of, Third. The fire on the leaves will eventually burn greater and stronger... It will flash its light and protect this village.
Iruka Umino said:
(Naruto)
When a person dies, he disappears, along with his past, current lifestyle, and his future. Many people die in missions and wars. They die easily and in surprisingly simple ways. Hayate was one of them. Those who die have goals and dreams. But everyone has something as important as those. Parents, siblings, friends, lovers... people who are important to you. They trust and help each other. The bond between the people important to you ever since birth and the string that binds them becomes thicker and stronger as time goes by... It's beyond reason. Those bound to you by that string will do that because it is important.

Gaara said:
(Naruto)
Up until now, my bonds with others have only been ones of hatred and murder. But, seeing him fight so hard made me wonder what a bond really is. I think I understand a little now. Suffering, sadness...and joy. To be able to share it with another person. Naruto Uzumaki...when I fought him, I feel that is what he taught me.
Gaara said:
(Naruto)
I am a relic they want to get rid of, so why do I exist and live? In order to exist you need a purpose, to exist for no reason is the same as being dead... I would love only myself and fight for only myself. If all other people exist to magnify that love, then there is no more a splendid universe than this one...

Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
My master entrusted me with a lot, from big things to little things. It's the same for you an unlimited number of things, don't you think it's about time for us, to be the ones who entrust not the entrusted, it's a pain in the ass but I can't say that. Someday you'll be the one to treat others to ramen and you'll be called Master Naruto... We can't stay kids forever, like Asuma and Jiraiya, I wanna be as cool as them.
Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
*about girls* C'mon. You know what they're like. You can never figure them out. You never know where you could stand with them. The smallest things could put you in their bad side. Always playing little mind games with you. Trying to make you do what they want. They're just a big pain basically.
Nara Shikamaru said:
(Naruto)
Ughh. Great. What's the point in setting the alarm if I'm going to wake up before it goes off? What a total waste. Now I've gotta shut it off but I don't feel like moving. But if I don't shut it off it will just keep ringing and ringing. Sigh. It makes me tired just thinking about the whole thing. Some mornings are such a drag...

Three members of Team Guy specializes in Close-Contact battles so I often render aid from the distance. I don't mind providing back up, but I was hoping to find new ninja tools that would enable me to fight on the front lines.
Tenten said:

I won't let that happen. You're not getting off that easy. No way! The people you and Raiga killed, they all wanted to live but you didn't leave them that choice! You decided for them! Well you don't get to decide this time, ok?! You're gonna live and you're going to take some responsibility for all those people's lives you cut short!
Hiruzen Sarutobi said:

It is a place where every year shinobi are born, raised, grow old, fight, and die to protect their home. These people are precious to me. We share a home, we share a life, and though we may not share ties of blood, they are precious to me. They are my family. And if I do fall, you still will fail. I am only one of a long line. I carry this title in trust for those Hokage who came before and those who will come after. I am the Third Hokage!

Jiraiya, are you the one who taught him the Rasengan? Are you acting like a teacher by teaching him something he can't master? Don't give him any ideas! That's why this kid likes to daydream that he's going to become Hokage someday.

Sharks start out as eggs, but incubate and hatch in the womb. Sometimes the number of pups is less than the number of eggs that were fertilized. Do you know why? Cannibalism. The pups start eating each other within the mother's womb the moment they hatch. They start killing their siblings the moment they enter the world, viewing everything they see as nothing more than prey. As of today you and I are fellow members of Akatsuki. So be careful... of me.

Sasori...your strength came because of your soul, not in spite of it. You tried to erase it, to become a puppet yourself, but couldn't change completely. Now you've got your immortal body, but you've fallen, sunk to the level of the puppets you used to control. You were supposed to be a top class ninja puppeteer, not a worthless nobody who lets someone else pull the strings.

*to Naruto* Lord Jiraiya only had praise for you. He was always boasting about you, saying you were like his own grandchild. He had faith that you were the one who would inherit his will, and truly believed that you would one day be a great Hokage. Lord Jiraiya will always watch over you. Even this very minute, he's watching from somewhere. He wouldn't be happy seeing you sad like this. So...be your usual self, the one he praised so much. Don't stay depressed forever. For Lord Jiraiya himself, one of the Legendary Sannin...acknowledged you as his promising student!
